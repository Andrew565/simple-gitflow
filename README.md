Thanks go to [Jason Volpe](https://github.com/jasonvolpe) for the 'Get current branch name' code used in the rake tasks.

Also to the various authors and contributors of the [Rake documentation](http://rake.rubyforge.org/files/doc/rakefile_rdoc.html) and [this Stack Overflow article](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/825748/how-do-i-pass-command-line-arguments-to-a-rake-task) for helping me figure out how to do the fanciness with passing command-line arguments to Rake.
